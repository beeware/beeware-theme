Theme checklist
---------------

Things to manually check:

Titlebar
~~~~~~~~

A dark gray titlebar is on the page. This confirms the theme template has been applied.

Site icon
~~~~~~~~~

The icon top-left has been rendered. This confirms the template can reference external resources.

Heading font
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Headings are rendered in Cutive. This confirms the BeeWare custom CSS theme has been applied.

Sidebar links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sidebar links exist, and point to the ``beeware-theme`` repo. This confirms that the sidebar content has been loaded, and the Github repo name has been set in the Sphinx context.

Custom static content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The title of this section is rendered in dark red. This confirms that the docs project can still provide static content.
