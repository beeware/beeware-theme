Things to manually check:

Titlebar
~~~~~~~~

A dark gray titlebar is on the page. This confirms the theme template has been applied.

Header and logo icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The header icon top-left has been rendered. This confirms the template can reference
external resources.

The logo icon in the left sidebar has been rendered. This confirms the sidebar will
render properly on the target sites.

Heading font
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Headings are rendered in Cutive. This confirms the BeeWare custom CSS theme has been
applied.

Inline Code
~~~~~~~~~~~

Inline code is rendered in the same color as the surrounding font. This confirms that
the theme has not caused any undesired changes.

This is text with ``inline code`` here and ``inline code`` here.

Tabbed Content Code

Code is in a contrasting color to the background. This confirms that the theme has not
caused any undesired changes.
